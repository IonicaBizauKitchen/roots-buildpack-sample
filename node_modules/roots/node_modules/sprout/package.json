[Read this](http://markup.im/#q4_cRZ1Q) for more details.\n\n### Why should you care?\n\nA lot of the time you make projects with similar starting templates/boilerplates. There are a number of different standard boilerplates out there (like h5bp), but everyone has their own preferences and tweaks. The goal of sprout is to allow you to write a base template once that is somewhat configurable where it needs to be then initialize the template with the options you choose from the command line or through a javascript API to get a jumpstart on your project.\n\nThere is another project called [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init) that does just about the same thing, but after [experimenting with it](https://github.com/carrot/grunt-init-node) a bit, we weren't huge fans of the API or the way that it was set up.\n\n### Installation\n\n```\nnpm install sprout -g\n```\n\n### CLI Usage\n\nSprout can be used directly through the command line to intitialize projects. Once installed, it exposes the `sprout` binary, which you can use to add, remove, and/or use your templates. The commands are more or less what you would expect, and are listed below. For reference, words in bold are necessary to type out as-is, words in italic represent placeholders for user input, and words in brackets represent optional arguments.\n\nCommand params in `[brackets]` are optional, and in `<angle_brackets>` are required.\n\n##### Add Template\n\n* * *\n\n_Command Syntax_: `sprout add [name] <clone_url> [options]`     \n_Description_: Adds a template to your repertoire. Name represents how you would like the template to be named within sprout, and clone url is a url that `git clone` could be run with and it would be successful. If no name is provided, sprout will use the last piece of the clone url as the name.  \n_Options:_  `--local` allows you to symlink a local project for active development. use a `path` instead of a `clone_url`\n\n\n##### Remove Template\n\n* * *\n\n_Command Syntax_: `sprout remove <name>`    \n_Description_: Removes the template with the specified name from sprout.\n\n##### List Templates\n\n* * *\n\n_Command Syntax_: `sprout list`    \n_Description_: Lists all templates that you have added to sprout.\n\n##### Initialize Template\n\n* * *\n\n_Command Syntax_: `sprout init <name> [path]`    \n_Description_: Initializes the template with the given name at the given path. If no path is provided it will create a new folder with the same name as the template in the current working directory. If there already is one, it will throw an error.\n\nSprout also comes with a [man page](man) and will display a help menu as a refresher on these commands if you type something wrong.\n\n### Javascript API\n\nSprout was made specifically to be easy to integrate into javascript applications and libraries that create project structures for you. It can be installed locally via npm and used directly in a node project. The API is similar to the CLI interface described above. Each method returns a [A+ compliant](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) promise (with extra sugar from [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when)) Example code given in coffeescript:\n\n```coffee\npath = require 'path'\nsprout = require 'sprout'\n\n# Adding a template\n# -----------------\nsprout.add({ name: 'node', url: 'https://github.com/carrot/sprout-node', options: {local: false} })\n  .catch(console.error.bind(console))\n  .done(-> console.log('template added!'))\n\n# removing a template\n# -------------------\nsprout.remove('node')\n  .catch(console.error.bind(console))\n  .done(-> console.log('template removed!'))\n\n# listing templates\n# -----------------\n\n# this comes back as a js object\ntemplates = sprout.list()\n\n# this comes back as a formatted and colored string inteded to\n# to be printed to the command line\nconsole.log sprout.list(pretty: true)\n\n# initializing a template\n# -----------------------\n\nsprout.init({\n  template: 'node',\n  path: path.join(process.cwd(), 'new_project'),\n  options: { foo: 'bar' } # optional, will prompt if not provided\n}).catch(console.error.bind(console))\n  .done(-> console.log('project initialized!'))\n\n# other things\n# ------------\n\n# returns the path that templates are stored in\nconsole.log sprout.path()\n\n# returns the path of the template name passed in\nconsole.log sprout.path('node')\n\n```\n\n### Writing Your Own Templates\n\nOk so enough about how this is used, I'm sure you are super excited at this point to get in there and write a template. Probably more excited than a [party gorilla](http://www.ivanwalsh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/the-oatmeal-cartoon.jpg), which is pretty wild. So let's take a look.\n\nFirst thing you'll want to do is set up your project structure, which will probably look something like this:\n\n```\nroot\n`- files...\ninit.coffee\nreadme.md\nlicense.md\n```\n\nSo a folder called `root` where the actual template goes, an `init.coffee` where we'll set up the config and stuff, and then any other files you need like a readme and license, which will *not* be included with the template. If you don't want any config options, you don't even need the `init.coffee`, just the `root` folder with the files in it and that's it. But let's assume you are after some additional configuration and jump into `init.coffee`.\n\n```coffee\n\n# This function is executed before any of the configuration happens.\n# It's a good place to put any introductory messages you want to display.\n# It is of course optional, and can be asynchronous.\nexports.before = (sprout, done) ->\n  console.log 'welcome! this is my before message'\n  done()\n\n# Configure is exposed as an array, which accepts any number of\n# arguments. Each argument can be a string or an object. A string\n# will prompt the user directly for that value, and using an object\n# allows you to configure a slightly more customizable prompt.\n\n# The 'prompt' option in an object has a couple of preset values you\n# conforms to the configuration used by flatiron/prompt, found here:\n# https://github.com/flatiron/prompt#valid-property-settings\nexports.configure = [\n  'name',\n  'github_url',\n  { name: 'travis'\n    message: 'use travis-ci? (y/n)'\n    validator: /y|n/\n    default: 'y' }\n]\n\n# This function is executed after the configuration info is collected.\n# It's a good place to do any other custom config you need, like building\n# extra files etc. You have the full power of node at your fingertips here.\nexports.after = (sprout, done) ->\n  console.log sprout.config_values # all the config values you collected\n  if not sprout.config_values.travis == 'y' then sprout.remove('.travis.yml')\n  done()\n\n```\n\nSo between this config file and the root folder, you should be able to make anything happen fairly easily. If not, please open up and issue and we'll try to make it happening-er and/or easier for you : )\n",
